This repo shares the code of Model 3 in paper "Personalized Course Prerequisite Inference for Goal-basedRecommendation" by Weijie Jiang, Zachary A. Pardos, and Qiang Wei, which is accepted by The 9th International Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference. (As Model 1 and Model 2 have simpler RNN architectures and the evaluation code is almost the same.)

train: regarding to section 5 'student grade prediction'
prerequisite_evaluation: regarding to section 6 'prerequisite courses prediction'
student_evaluation: regarding to section 7 'student goal-based course selection prediction'
