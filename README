Pardos, and Qiang Wei, which in Proceedings of the 9th International Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference (LAK'19). (As Model 1 and Model 2 have simpler RNN architectures and the evaluation code is almost the same.)

prerequisite_evaluation: regarding section 6 'prerequisite courses prediction'
