Accepted by The 9th International Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference. (As Model1 and Model2 is has simpler RNN architecture and the evaluation code is almost the same.)

train: regarding to section 5 'student grade prediction'
prerequisite_evaluation: regarding to section 6 'prerequisite courses prediction'
