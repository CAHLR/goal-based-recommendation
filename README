This repo shares the code of Model3 in paper "Personalized Course Prerequisite Inference for Goal-basedRecommendation". (As Model1 and Model2 is has simpler RNN architecture and the evaluation code is almost the same.)

train: regarding to section 5 'student grade prediction'
prerequisite_evaluation: regarding to section 6 'prerequisite courses prediction'
student_evaluation: regarding to section 7 'student goal-based course selection prediction'
